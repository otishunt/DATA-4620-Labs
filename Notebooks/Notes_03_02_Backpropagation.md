### Gradient and Jacobian

Given a function $f : \mathbb{R}^n : \mathbb{R}$ the **gradient** is the vector of partial derivatives:

$$\nabla_{\vec{x}} f(\vec{x}) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_1}} \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_n}} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

If the function has a vector output, $g : \mathbb{R}^n : \mathbb{R}^m$, then we instead have a $m \times n$ **Jacobian matrix** $J$ of all partial derivatives:

$$J  =
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial{g_1}}{\partial{x_1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial{g_1}}{\partial{x_n}} \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial{g_m}}{\partial{x_1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial{g_m}}{\partial{x_n}} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Note that the Jacobian matrix has size $m \times n$ where $m$ is the number of outputs and $n$ is the number of inputs.  The rows of the Jacobian correspond to the outputs, and the columns correspond to the inputs.

As a shorthand, I will write both the gradient and the Jacobian using the partial derivative notation, so that if $\vec{y}=g(\vec{x})$ then the Jacobian is $\partial{\vec{y}}/\partial{\vec{x}}$.

### Generalized chain rule 

The generalized chain rule applies when computing partial derivatives of vector-valued functions:

$$L = L(f_1(x),f_2(x),\ldots,f_m(x))$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{\partial L}{\partial f_i}\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x}$$

When $\vec{x}$ is a $n \times 1$ vector, we have

$$L = L(f_1(\vec{x}),f_2(\vec{x}),\ldots,f_m(\vec{x}))$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_j} = \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{\partial L}{\partial f_i}\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}$$

$$=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial f_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial L}{\partial f_m}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_j} \\ \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_j}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$=\frac{\partial L}{\partial f} 
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}.
$$

Now we see that we can write the entire outer Jacobian matrix calculation as a multiplication of the inner Jacobians which implements the generalized chain rule:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \vec{x}} 
= \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial f_1} & \cdots  \frac{\partial L}{\partial f_n}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_m} \\
& \ddots &\\
\frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_m}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$=
\frac{\partial L}{\partial f} 
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \vec{x}}.
$$

### Jacobians of common neural network operations

#### Loss functions

The derivative of the squared error loss function is simple to derive:

$$L(z) = \frac{1}{2}(z-y)^2$$
$$\frac{dL}{dz} = (z-y)$$

#### Activation functions

The ReLU activation function is written as follows:

$$\textrm{ReLU}(x) = \min(0,x)$$

Clearly $\partial{\textrm{ReLU}}/\partial x = 0$ when $x<0$ and 1 when $x>0$.

What about when $x=0$?  ReLU is not differentiable at this point.  However, we can employ a [subderivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subderivative) and say that the slope is 0 at $x=0$.  This choice allows gradient descent to function properly with convex but non-differentiable functions like ReLU.

So in summary we have:

$$\frac{\partial{\textrm{ReLU}}}{\partial x} = \begin{cases}
0 && \textrm{if } x \leq 0 \\
1 && \textrm{if } x > 0.
\end{cases}
$$

Another way of writing this is $\partial{\textrm{ReLU}}/\partial{x}=[x>0].$

When we apply the activation function to a vector $\vec{x}$, so that we have $\vec{s}=\textrm{ReLU}(\vec{x})$, ReLU is simply applied to each element in the same way.  Therefore the Jacobian is a diagonal matrix of ones and zeros:

$$\frac{\partial{\vec{s}}}{\partial \vec{x}} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
[x_1>0] & & & \\
& [x_2>0] & & \\
& & \ddots & \\
& & & [x_n>0]
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Suppose we have already calculated $\partial{L}/\partial{\vec{s}}$ and we now want to calculate $\partial{L}/\partial{\vec{x}}$.  By the chain rule we have

$$\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{\vec{x}}}=
\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{\vec{s}}}
\frac{\partial{\vec{s}}}{\partial{\vec{x}}}
$$
$$
=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{s_1}} & \cdots  & \frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{s_n}}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
[x_1>0] & & & \\
& [x_2>0] & & \\
& & \ddots & \\
& & & [x_n>0]
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{s_1}}[x_1>0] & \cdots  & \frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{s_n}}[x_n>0]
\end{bmatrix}
$$

So we see that all we need to is zero out $\partial{L}/\partial{\vec{s}}$ wherever $\vec{x}\leq0$.

#### Linear transformation

Now consider the linear transformation, the building block of the multi-layer perceptron:

$$\vec{z} = W\vec{x}+\vec{b}$$

We will first consider $\partial{\vec{z}}/\partial{\vec{b}}$.  Clearly for each element $z_i$, the derivative with respect to $b_i$ is one and the derivative with respect to all other elements of $\vec{b}$ is zero.  So we simply have the identity matrix:

$$\frac{\partial{\vec{z}}}{\partial{\vec{b}}} = I.$$

Now for the Jacobians w.r.t. $\vec{x}$ and $W$.  First, let's look at how each element of $\vec{z}$ is computed:

$$z_i = \sum_{k=1}^{n} W_{ik} x_k + b_i.$$

Therefore $\partial{z_i}/\partial{x_j} = W_{ij}$ and it follows that $\partial{\vec{z}}/\partial \vec{x} = W$.

Now we consider $\partial{\vec{z}}/\partial{W}$.  Looking at the computation of $z_i$, we see that

$$
\frac{\partial{z_i}}{\partial{w_{jk}}}=
\begin{cases}
x_k & \textrm{if } i=j \\
0 & \textrm{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

It follows that

$$
\frac{\partial{z_i}}{\partial{W_j}}=
\begin{cases}
\vec{x}^T & \textrm{if } i=j \\
0 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where $W_j$ is the $j$-th row of $W$.

If we are aiming to compute the Jacobian $\partial L/\partial W$ for the loss function $L(\vec{z})$, we see that the computation collapses nicely into an outer product of two vectors. First looking at the Jacobian w.r.t $W_j$:

$$\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{W_j}} =\sum_{i=1}^{m} 
\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{z_i}}
\frac{\partial{z_i}}{W_j}
=\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{z_j}}
\frac{\partial{z_j}}{W_j}
=\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{z_j}}
\vec{x}^T.
$$

Now we put the rows together to form $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}$:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}
=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{W_1}} \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{W_m}}
\end{bmatrix}
=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{z_1}}
\vec{x}^T \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{z_m}}
\vec{x}^T
\end{bmatrix}$$

$$=\left(\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{\vec{z}}}\right)^T\vec{x}^T.$$ 

### Backpropagation

Consider a multi-layer perceptron with a single hidden layer with ReLU activation and a output layer size of 1.  Here is the step-by-step computation from input $\vec{x}$ to output $z$ and loss $L$:

$$\vec{h} = W^{(1)} \vec{x} + \vec{b}^{(1)}$$
$$\vec{s} = \textrm{ReLU}(\vec{h})$$
$$z = W^{(2)} \vec{s} + b^{(2)}$$
$$L = \frac{1}{2}(y-z)^2$$

This is called the "forward" step as the computation flows forward from the input to the output and then the loss.

Now we want to calculate the derivatives of the loss $L$ w.r.t. the weights $W^{(1)},\vec{b}^{(1)},W^{(2)},$ and $b^{(2)}$.  This is called the "backward" step as we need to calculate the derivatives starting from the loss and moving backward toward the input, applying the generalized chain rule as we go.

For example, to calculate $\partial L/\partial W^{(2)}$ and $\partial L/\partial b^{(2)}$ we need to use the chain rule:

$$\frac{\partial L}{W^{(2)}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial W^{(2)}}$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{b^{(2)}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial b^{(2)}}.$$

Note that we can compute $\partial L / \partial z$ once and reuse it for both computations.

As we move backward, we can continue to update the loss gradient through the chain rule:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \vec{s}} = 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial z}
\frac{\partial z}{\partial \vec{s}}$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \vec{h}} = 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \vec{s}}
\frac{\partial \vec{s}}{\partial \vec{h}}$$


Finally we arrive at the Jacobians for $W^{(1)}$ and $\vec{b}^{(1)}$:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{(1)}} = 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \vec{h}}
\frac{\partial \vec{h}}{\partial W^{(1)}}
$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \vec{b}^{(1)}} = 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \vec{h}}
\frac{\partial \vec{h}}{\partial  \vec{b}^{(1)}}
$$

As explained above, in practice some of these computations are not implemented as matrix multiplications but instead performed in a more efficient manner, depending on the function being differentiated.
